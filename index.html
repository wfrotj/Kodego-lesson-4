  <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>

  <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <p>Heading define the outline of our webpage. There are six levels of headings.</p>

  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>This is how we make an unordered list:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Add a "ul" element(it stands for unordered list)
    <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
    <li>They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is what an order list looks like:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>

    <li>Also, note how the number increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things is in precise order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
  <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
  <p>Other times, you need to <strong> strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
  <h3><em>And sometimes you need to shout!</em></h3>
  <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
  <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
